Teams are spread across geographies and try to provide support round the year. Sometimes there are circumstances where due to heavy workload certain request resolutions are delayed, impacting company’s business. Some of the requests are very generic where a proper resolution procedure delivered to the user can solve the problem. Company is looking forward to design an automation which can interact with the user, understand the problem and display the resolution procedure [ if found as a generic request ] or redirect the request to an actual human support executive if the request is complex or not in it’s database"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"k_sa4huIxSmR"},"source":["# DATA DESCRIPTION: A sample corpus is attached for your reference.
